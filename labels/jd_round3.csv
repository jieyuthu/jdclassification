"The Senior Data Warehouse QA Engineer is responsible for performing quality assurance duties throughout the data warehouse project life cycle. This position requires a self-motivated individual with a combination of at least 5-7 years QA and/or Oracle development (SQL and PL/SQL) experience.
Primary responsibilities include working with business owners and developers to create, execute and update test plans and test cases for necessary projects and application releases. In the execution of the QA tests, this person will be responsible for documenting bugs and showing developers exactly how to reproduce them as well as assessing the overall quality for the particular project. Also this senior member of the team will provide suggestions on how to improve and tune inefficient code. Excellent communications skills, the in-depth ability to solve technical problems as well as the ability to mentor a team of QA engineers in a fast-paced environment are required skills for this position.
1. Oversee, develop and execute test cases based on business requirements for projects that utilize several high-end development features of Oracle 11g such as Materialized views, Partitioning, Parallelism, etc. In addition to his/her own QA projects, the Senior QA Engineer will be responsible for reviewing and approving all test cases submitted by other members of the Data Warehouse QA team.
2. After compiling packages, procedures and functions in a personalized self-created schema, the senior QA engineer will be responsible for debugging and reporting defects in our Jira bug tracking tool and escalate issues as needed. This will require the person to add procedural code for debugging purposes in most cases, in order to report on which step in the process the code is currently in as well as how much data has been manipulated, etc.
3. Carefully and methodologically perform validation after releases are deployed to ensure proper release of code. This task will require the Senior QA Engineer to ensure the proper code has been released to the production schema by performing a ""diff"" of what is in production versus what was supposed to be pushed. It will also require validation of data, if a data migration was involved in the release.
 4. Develop and maintain a thorough knowledge of the data warehouse applications as well as an understanding of database administration and design principles. This knowledge will be necessary in order to troubleshoot issues in the code that have to do with SQL performance. Because of the large volume of data in our Data Warehouse, SQL tuning is a necessary skill for the Senior QA Engineer to acquire and apply while testing code.
5. Maintain an in-depth understanding of our coding standards and enforce the guidelines throughout the testing phase. Our coding standards should be incorporated in every piece of code that is tested. If a developer misses any coding standard or uses one incorrectly, it is the responsibility of the Senior QA Engineer to report this defect and ensure our standards are adhered to by everyone on the team, since the QA Engineer is the final reviewer before code gets pushed to production.
6. Communicate effectively to the team throughout the QA lifecycle. The Senior QA Engineer will be responsible for providing time estimates for each project for QA testing. If at any point in the testing of code the timeline needs to change, we will look to the senior member of the team to escalate this as an issue and come up with an appropriate action plan, particularly when deadlines will be impacted.
7. Participate in Design and Requirements reviews for proposed new features and updates. It is necessary for the Senior QA Engineer to be involved in design sessions in order to gain his/her understanding of the project, since they may have a differing perspective from the developer. In order to ensure we receive a 360 degree view of the project requirements, it is necessary for both the developer and QA engineer to participate in all of the initial requirements reviews.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Project Athenian ( https://www.cloudflare.com/athenian/ ): We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership ( https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/path-forward/ ): Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1 ( https://1.1.1.1/ ): We released1.1.1.1 ( https://1.1.1.1/ ) to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by ourprivacy policy ( https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/ ) and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Partner with other functional areas to develop metrics, understand analytical needs, and interpret results about our crops and our business.
Collaborate on the design and creation of data tools used by our farm operators, agricultural scientists, and sales team.

You have experience or affinity for the tools we love: AWS, snowflake, dbt, python, R, Mode, and enjoy learning more.
You are comfortably leading a highly technical team: defining processes around version control, peer-reviewing code, and managing processes in production. You’d enjoy teaching members of the team on aspects they’re less familiar with.
You are comfortable being the technical resource for non-technical teams: translating business needs to technical requirements, communicating quantitative observations to make the teams around us more effective and well-informed.
You’re confident taking ownership of projects from start to finish and enjoy the process of turning nebulous ideas into reality.
You believe that teams succeed and fail together and take responsibility for ensuring the success and safety of your teammates.

We are a profitable, bootstrapped tech startup offering competitive salary + equity packages to top candidates. Our office is in the Innovation Hub in Downtown Gainesville. Our first cofounders met as early hires at the successful fintech startup, Square.


Bridgerock Data is a Data Science first technology company focused on direct to consumer brands (DTC). This ecommerce market is growing fast. Few people know that at $61bn per year, the ecommerce platform, Shopify, sells more online than Walmart, and may soon pass the entire chain.


Shopify, and its competitors, enable creative retail startups to flourish. The most successful of these all hit a major growth painpoint: Brands must advertise to grow, but marketers fear wasting money on ads.


Bridgerock uses Data Science to show which ads are wasting money. We are not an AdTech agency. We audit the AdTech agencies. We solve important, practical, challenging problems. We focus on accuracy. Cutting low impact marketing spend is a big advantage to our clients.


We are taking applications for several technical positions. If you are interested in what we do, or know our stack, please apply online or submit your resume and cover letter to people@bridgerockdata.com.

Although remote work can be considered. (Please note that all work right now is remote due to COVID-19). Our Climate Analytics team is McKinsey’s core team of experts who analyze, and generate insights from, the quantitative impact of climate change for our clients.
McKinsey’s Climate Analytics team is a small, close-knit team of ~8 within a broader team called ACRE. ACRE is composed of ~40 data scientists, engineers and expert consultants dedicated to conducting advanced analytics for food and agriculture clients. Although our Climate Analytics team is officially part of ACRE, and many of your core clients served will be agriculture clients because of this, our Climate Analytics team works across all sectors at McKinsey being impacted by climate change—for example, the public, energy, and financial sectors. Regardless of the sectors in which you work, you will get the opportunity to work with multi-disciplinary teams with digital, analytics, research and business backgrounds.
ACRE—and through extension, our Climate Analytics team—is an agile team within the firm whose goal is to use the latest analytical methods, incubate new technologies and drive innovative ways to develop new opportunities for the firm to make significant and lasting client impact – redefining what it means to provide the “best of the firm” to our clients.
WHAT YOU'LL DO
You will leverage deep knowledge of climate and earth systems as well as analytical expertise to provide insights to clients (as part of a client service team), within ACRE by strengthening our core client product offerings, and across McKinsey and the public by synthesizing and disseminating climate-related insights via internally and externally published articles and visualizations.
Approximately half of your time will be spent solving specific business problems on client projects (either remotely or on site) and the other half of your time spent developing new, or improving upon existing, products for the Climate Analytics team within ACRE.
As a member of a client service team, you will leverage your creativity and problem-solving skills to design solutions to core business problems that best meet client needs and communicate the outcomes and insights of your work to primarily non-technical executive audiences. Some of the issues we are tasked with on a client project include: retrieving and processing large amounts of data from cloud storage, conducting analyses and generating insight based on medium to long term projected changes in climate, and more generally utilizing climate domain expertise to provide climate-specific insight and inform strategy for addressing climate risk across industries.
When working internally with the ACRE team, you will improve current product offerings (what we call “IP development”) to best meet our most common client needs. You will work in a collaborative agile team environment where you will bring together a variety of global data sources, implement different algorithms and utilize cutting edge methodologies and approaches to develop proprietary solutions. You will work together with our data engineering team to design and deploy applications and dashboards to deliver faster, more impactful insights to our clients.
Along the way, you will learn how to structure business problems and serve as a client advisor while working closely with other data scientists/engineers and senior leaders across industries shaping the future of climate. You will have access to unparalleled career acceleration, with ownership and responsibility to lead the work you do from day one in a collaborative, diverse, non-hierarchical environment. You will have the opportunity to travel to client sites, locally and around the world. Lastly, you will be able to provide direct and measurable impact to some of the largest players from energy to agriculture around the globe.",1

WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH
You’ll work with McKinsey’s Climate Analytics team, ideally co-located with our team in Denver or Brussel.
Our Climate Analytics team is McKinsey’s core team of experts who analyze, and generate insights from, the quantitative impact of climate change for our clients.
McKinsey’s Climate Analytics team is a small, close-knit team of ~8 within a broader team called ACRE. ACRE is composed of ~40 data scientists, engineers and expert consultants dedicated to conducting advanced analytics for food and agriculture clients. Although our Climate Analytics team is officially part of ACRE, and many of your core clients served will be agriculture clients because of this, our Climate Analytics team works across all sectors at McKinsey being impacted by climate change—for example, the public, energy, and financial sectors. Regardless of the sectors in which you work, you will get the opportunity to work with multi-disciplinary teams with digital, analytics, research and business backgrounds.
ACRE—and through extension, our Climate Analytics team—is an agile team within the firm whose goal is to use the latest analytical methods, incubate new technologies and drive innovative ways to develop new opportunities for the firm to make significant and lasting client impact – redefining what it means to provide the “best of the firm” to our clients.
WHAT YOU'LL DO
You will leverage deep knowledge of climate and earth systems as well as analytical expertise to provide insights to clients (as part of a client service team), within ACRE by strengthening our core client product offerings, and across McKinsey and the public by synthesizing and disseminating climate-related insights via internally and externally published articles and visualizations.
Approximately half of your time will be spent solving specific business problems on client projects (either remotely or on site) and the other half of your time spent developing new, or improving upon existing, products for the Climate Analytics team within ACRE.
As a member of a client service team, you will leverage your creativity and problem-solving skills to design solutions to core business problems that best meet client needs and communicate the outcomes and insights of your work to primarily non-technical executive audiences. Some of the issues we are tasked with on a client project include: retrieving and processing large amounts of data from cloud storage, conducting analyses and generating insight based on medium to long term projected changes in climate, and more generally utilizing climate domain expertise to provide climate-specific insight and inform strategy for addressing climate risk across industries.
When working internally with the ACRE team, you will improve current product offerings (what we call “IP development”) to best meet our most common client needs. You will work in a collaborative agile team environment where you will bring together a variety of global data sources, implement different algorithms and utilize cutting edge methodologies and approaches to develop proprietary solutions. You will work together with our data engineering team to design and deploy applications and dashboards to deliver faster, more impactful insights to our clients.
Along the way, you will learn how to structure business problems and serve as a client advisor while working closely with other data scientists/engineers and senior leaders across industries shaping the future of climate. You will have access to unparalleled career acceleration, with ownership and responsibility to lead the work you do from day one in a collaborative, diverse, non-hierarchical environment. You will have the opportunity to travel to client sites, locally and around the world. Lastly, you will be able to provide direct and measurable impact to some of the largest players from energy to agriculture around the globe.",1
