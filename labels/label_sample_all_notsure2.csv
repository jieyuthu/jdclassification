For these positions, they are asking for us to provide data analysts that are passionate about transforming and making data usable for new services, business models, and to help economic development. We are looking for people that believe data is the new gold.
We are looking for data analysts, data wranglers, data scientists with excellent leadership, technical, and subject matter expertise qualities. We have projects lining up developing research-grade science data algorithms from in-situ sensors to bringing together data sources from disparate sub-agencies into enterprise platforms to make available on open-data platforms. We have projects that are creating data and bigdata prototypes whether it be on CartoDB geospatial, D3 Sankeys and various libraries, feeding and harvesting RDF Triplets into catalogs, or integrating into SEO environments. Admittedly, we have some less sexy data wrangling and janitor tasks that will require more ETL skills to hone in on.
To boot, we want our analysts to be natural change agents and passionate about change while empathetic to the clients environment on how they leverage, mature, and incorporate data products, services, and new capabilities. We want leaders who can both support the influence of the right change direction while managing the technical and business analysis and design, and are skilled and self-motivated with solid domain/subject matter expertise.
Our analysts will be on teams that, through facilitated analysis, work shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates to come up with the conceptual and logical design and architecture. Analysts will also be working very closely with client staff or system integrators to rapidly implement changes or agile release. Furthermore, we devise and craft strategies and communications solutions to broadcast and brag about their change efforts and results. This is what we do – we bring transformations to life.

All roles will require strong communication and interactive skills - oral, written, visual especially for triaging conflict, ideation barriers, mitigating risk, foster thought diversity and team environment. We expect all our roles to have a mastery of their technical level at their role whether that be in architectural methods, languages, work products, consulting techniques, and client culture. If they are not, they need to demonstrate how they are VERY fast learners.
For the technical prowess, we will want you to demonstrate your data science nerd-dom and technology stack as part of normal vernacular in one or many of these stacks (well, technologies in these stacks depending on the project). Of course, by no means do we expect all of the technologies, but prowess in one of the stacks:
Data Transformation – ETL, perl, python, SQL, FTP, Informatica, SAFE/FME, Kettle, GeoKettle
- Machine Learning - Markov or Markov Chain, Naive Bayes, N-Grams, Levenshtein distance or Damerau-Levenshtein distance, Fuzzy Search, NLP,

- Analysis - Someone who can 'read' a dataset and 'tell its story' - top points for ""food desert analysis"", ""restaurant inspections analysis"", ""bike trails routing analysis"" - or any other specific ""human geography"" and/or ""land use"" analysis. Ideally this person can use tools like GIS/RS, Tableau, Carto, D3, JavaScript, Python, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator.

"Job Details
Job ID: 12135

Do you excel in an environment that values exploration and discovery? We have a universe of opportunities waiting for you!

New ideas are all around us, but only a few will change the world. That is our focus at JPL. We ask the biggest questions, and then search the universe for answers—literally. We build upon ideas that have guided generations, and then share our discoveries to inspire generations to come. Your mission—your opportunity—is to seek out the answers that bring us one-step closer. If you are driven to discover, create, and inspire something, that lasts a lifetime and beyond, you are ready for JPL.

JPL's Instrument Software and Science Data Systems Section (Org. 398) consist of multidisciplinary teams of engineers and technologists who provide expertise across the domains of instrument operations and science data systems.

We are responsible for:
Safely controlling JPL remote sensing instruments.
Transforming data collected by these instruments into scientific measurements and preserving them for future analyses.
Providing context and understanding to the measurements.
Making the measurements and related information accessible to a broad and global user community: scientists, operations, decision makers and society.

Our engineering teams build and operate high performance data processing, management and analysis systems capable of handling petabyte scale datasets in support of science discovery, research, operations and applications.

We support JPL and NASA missions, as well as other science-based projects. Our research and technology development teams create new onboard and ground based technologies for data processing, analysis, modeling, reasoning, visualization, management, access and analytics that are infused into our data systems.

Located in Pasadena, California, JPL has a campus-like environment situated on 177 acres in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and offers a work environment unlike any other: we inspire passion, foster innovation, build collaboration, and reward excellence.

We aim to do things never done before and to go places few can go. We dare mighty things…do you?

Responsibilities

As a member of the Science Data Modeling and Computing Group (Org. 398K), you will report to the Technical Group Supervisor of 398K. You will be working on the following four projects: Megacity Carbon, Multi-sale Methane Analytic Framework, and Multi-tiered Carbon Monitoring System. The four projects have strong synergy in technical approaches and overall goals.

The Megacity Carbon project will establish an observational, modeling, and analytical framework to enable sustained monitoring and attribution of trends in the anthropogenic CO2 and CH4 emissions of the world’s largest cities sufficient to independently validate the efficacy of the carbon stabilization policies of those cities and to support improvements in urban and regional scale emission inventories. Under the Megacity Carbon project, you will
Assimilate surface observations to satellite observations in the urban megacities.
Perform science data analyses to close carbon budgets and partition emission sources to emission sectors.
Produce the analysis results and supporting data, methods and uncertainty/error estimates.
Present the results in a policy relevant fashion to local decision makers.
The Global and Regional Methane Budget (GRMB) project will quantify and partition the global and regional methane budget using satellite and ground based measurements of methane and tracers of its sources and sinks. Under the GRMB project, you will
Operationalize the project’s prototype research code base so that these algorithms can be made modular and easily applied to regional to global scales.
Prototype the optical estimation algorithms in several methane-emitting regions.
Deliver an algorithm and prototype code to ingest a priori inventories and fluxes from aircraft and satellite.
Apply the optimal estimation methods on regional to global scales in order to partition methane inverse fluxes to sector specific emissions.
Write a paper on the North American methane budget.
The Multi-scale Methane Analytic Framework (M2AF) project will mature and integrate methane data analysis capabilities spanning multiple observing systems and spatial scales into an analytic center framework. M2AF will provide analytic tools to characterize methane fluxes and the physical processes that control them, provide workflow optimization and management tools, facilitate data search and discovery relevant to specific methane science investigations and applications, and provide collaborative, web-based tools for enabling scientific discussion and application of data analysis and modeling results. Under the M2AF project, you will
Develop regional methane flux inversion methods.
Produce validation results with the inversion methods.
Support the integration of the inversion methods into M2AF.
Write peer-reviewed papers to report the scientific results from the task.
The Multi-tiered Carbon Monitoring System (MtCMS) project will develop, deploy, and test MtCMS over a diverse set of US regions and emission sectors. The tiers refer both to different observing systems and emission estimation frameworks spanning multiple spatial scales. We will combine coordinated observations from remote-sensing aircraft and satellites and where available, surface in-situ observations to detect and quantify emissions from methane point sources and their surrounding regions in an extensible fashion. Under the MtCMS project, you will
Develop regional methane flux inversion methods.
Improve atmospheric retrievals of methane and carbon dioxide.
Provide validation results for the inversion methods and data products generated with the methods.
Support the integration of the data products and methods you developed to MtCMS.
Work closely with diverse stakeholder partners to demonstrate the utility of the data products and methods provided by MtCMS.

We are looking for people that believe data is the new gold.
We are looking for data analysts, data wranglers, data scientists with excellent leadership, technical, and subject matter expertise qualities. We have projects lining up developing research-grade science data algorithms from in-situ sensors to bringing together data sources from disparate sub-agencies into enterprise platforms to make available on open-data platforms. We have projects that are creating data and bigdata prototypes whether it be on CartoDB geospatial, D3 Sankeys and various libraries, feeding and harvesting RDF Triplets into catalogs, or integrating into SEO environments. Admittedly, we have some less sexy data wrangling and janitor tasks that will require more ETL skills to hone in on.
To boot, we want our analysts to be natural change agents and passionate about change while empathetic to the clients environment on how they leverage, mature, and incorporate data products, services, and new capabilities. We want leaders who can both support the influence of the right change direction while managing the technical and business analysis and design, and are skilled and self-motivated with solid domain/subject matter expertise.
Our analysts will be on teams that, through facilitated analysis, work shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates to come up with the conceptual and logical design and architecture. Analysts will also be working very closely with client staff or system integrators to rapidly implement changes or agile release. Furthermore, we devise and craft strategies and communications solutions to broadcast and brag about their change efforts and results. This is what we do – we bring transformations to life.
Position Requirements:
You will be expected to rapidly ramp-up on client lingo, proactively make observations of patterns, anomalies, problems, and be customer service focused. You will be expected to be highly self-motivated and understand you will be held accountable to commitments. We look for decisive individuals able to rapidly respond to change requests and able to communicate, track, and escalate risk.

All roles will require strong communication and interactive skills - oral, written, visual especially for triaging conflict, ideation barriers, mitigating risk, foster thought diversity and team environment. We expect all our roles to have a mastery of their technical level at their role whether that be in architectural methods, languages, work products, consulting techniques, and client culture. If they are not, they need to demonstrate how they are VERY fast learners.
For the technical prowess, we will want you to demonstrate your data science nerd-dom and technology stack as part of normal vernacular in one or many of these stacks (well, technologies in these stacks depending on the project). Of course, by no means do we expect all of the technologies, but prowess in one of the stacks:
Data Transformation – ETL, perl, python, SQL, FTP, Informatica, SAFE/FME, Kettle, GeoKettle

- Open Data User Experience - Someone who has gathered public data and used it in a project (and/or application), is aware that there is an industry wide 'current debate' about open data, and has filed a CORA/FOIA request to gather data.
- Analysis - Someone who can 'read' a dataset and 'tell its story' - top points for ""food desert analysis"", ""restaurant inspections analysis"", ""bike trails routing analysis"" - or any other specific ""human geography"" and/or ""land use"" analysis. Ideally this person can use tools like GIS/RS, Tableau, Carto, D3, JavaScript, Python, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator.
- Manual Data Entry - Has an eye for detail and has patience to meticulously check and double check others' data entry, and a desire to work with metadata. Can work in Excel and Google Sheets.

- Database Administration - Has a basic familiarity with relational database and geodatabase structures, organizing and maintaining data, metadata.
Finally, our data science analysts will need to meet the following:
1 year of consulting experience – higher compensation for additional 3 more years in related analytical work products and additional 2 more years in subject matter
Could pass ad-hoc technical and whiteboard test given various data ETL and other patterns of real-time, large data, data cleanup, etc. scenarios
For public sector work, our work is traditionally unclassified, but will require certain amount of background, reference, and other checks
Travel will be maximum 20%
We emphasize a balance of work and life and target 40-50 hour weeks with ample times to refresh with great paid-time off.

Able to work under competing, quickly-changing priorities, manage expectations effectively and support the team under pressure
Willingness to travel up to 50% (will likely travel 20-40%) (after current McKinsey travel restrictions due to COVID-19 are lifted; all work is currently remote)
WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH
You’ll work with McKinsey’s Climate Analytics team, ideally co-located with our team in Denver or Brussel.
Although remote work can be considered. (Please note that all work right now is remote due to COVID-19). Our Climate Analytics team is McKinsey’s core team of experts who analyze, and generate insights from, the quantitative impact of climate change for our clients.
McKinsey’s Climate Analytics team is a small, close-knit team of ~8 within a broader team called ACRE. ACRE is composed of ~40 data scientists, engineers and expert consultants dedicated to conducting advanced analytics for food and agriculture clients. Although our Climate Analytics team is officially part of ACRE, and many of your core clients served will be agriculture clients because of this, our Climate Analytics team works across all sectors at McKinsey being impacted by climate change—for example, the public, energy, and financial sectors. Regardless of the sectors in which you work, you will get the opportunity to work with multi-disciplinary teams with digital, analytics, research and business backgrounds.
ACRE—and through extension, our Climate Analytics team—is an agile team within the firm whose goal is to use the latest analytical methods, incubate new technologies and drive innovative ways to develop new opportunities for the firm to make significant and lasting client impact – redefining what it means to provide the “best of the firm” to our clients.
WHAT YOU'LL DO
You will leverage deep knowledge of climate and earth systems as well as analytical expertise to provide insights to clients (as part of a client service team), within ACRE by strengthening our core client product offerings, and across McKinsey and the public by synthesizing and disseminating climate-related insights via internally and externally published articles and visualizations.
Approximately half of your time will be spent solving specific business problems on client projects (either remotely or on site) and the other half of your time spent developing new, or improving upon existing, products for the Climate Analytics team within ACRE.
As a member of a client service team, you will leverage your creativity and problem-solving skills to design solutions to core business problems that best meet client needs and communicate the outcomes and insights of your work to primarily non-technical executive audiences. Some of the issues we are tasked with on a client project include: retrieving and processing large amounts of data from cloud storage, conducting analyses and generating insight based on medium to long term projected changes in climate, and more generally utilizing climate domain expertise to provide climate-specific insight and inform strategy for addressing climate risk across industries.
When working internally with the ACRE team, you will improve current product offerings (what we call “IP development”) to best meet our most common client needs. You will work in a collaborative agile team environment where you will bring together a variety of global data sources, implement different algorithms and utilize cutting edge methodologies and approaches to develop proprietary solutions. You will work together with our data engineering team to design and deploy applications and dashboards to deliver faster, more impactful insights to our clients.
Along the way, you will learn how to structure business problems and serve as a client advisor while working closely with other data scientists/engineers and senior leaders across industries shaping the future of climate. You will have access to unparalleled career acceleration, with ownership and responsibility to lead the work you do from day one in a collaborative, diverse, non-hierarchical environment. You will have the opportunity to travel to client sites, locally and around the world. Lastly, you will be able to provide direct and measurable impact to some of the largest players from energy to agriculture around the globe.",1

WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH
You’ll work with McKinsey’s Climate Analytics team, ideally co-located with our team in Denver or Brussel.
Our Climate Analytics team is McKinsey’s core team of experts who analyze, and generate insights from, the quantitative impact of climate change for our clients.
McKinsey’s Climate Analytics team is a small, close-knit team of ~8 within a broader team called ACRE. ACRE is composed of ~40 data scientists, engineers and expert consultants dedicated to conducting advanced analytics for food and agriculture clients. Although our Climate Analytics team is officially part of ACRE, and many of your core clients served will be agriculture clients because of this, our Climate Analytics team works across all sectors at McKinsey being impacted by climate change—for example, the public, energy, and financial sectors. Regardless of the sectors in which you work, you will get the opportunity to work with multi-disciplinary teams with digital, analytics, research and business backgrounds.
ACRE—and through extension, our Climate Analytics team—is an agile team within the firm whose goal is to use the latest analytical methods, incubate new technologies and drive innovative ways to develop new opportunities for the firm to make significant and lasting client impact – redefining what it means to provide the “best of the firm” to our clients.
WHAT YOU'LL DO
You will leverage deep knowledge of climate and earth systems as well as analytical expertise to provide insights to clients (as part of a client service team), within ACRE by strengthening our core client product offerings, and across McKinsey and the public by synthesizing and disseminating climate-related insights via internally and externally published articles and visualizations.
Approximately half of your time will be spent solving specific business problems on client projects (either remotely or on site) and the other half of your time spent developing new, or improving upon existing, products for the Climate Analytics team within ACRE.
As a member of a client service team, you will leverage your creativity and problem-solving skills to design solutions to core business problems that best meet client needs and communicate the outcomes and insights of your work to primarily non-technical executive audiences. Some of the issues we are tasked with on a client project include: retrieving and processing large amounts of data from cloud storage, conducting analyses and generating insight based on medium to long term projected changes in climate, and more generally utilizing climate domain expertise to provide climate-specific insight and inform strategy for addressing climate risk across industries.
When working internally with the ACRE team, you will improve current product offerings (what we call “IP development”) to best meet our most common client needs. You will work in a collaborative agile team environment where you will bring together a variety of global data sources, implement different algorithms and utilize cutting edge methodologies and approaches to develop proprietary solutions. You will work together with our data engineering team to design and deploy applications and dashboards to deliver faster, more impactful insights to our clients.
Along the way, you will learn how to structure business problems and serve as a client advisor while working closely with other data scientists/engineers and senior leaders across industries shaping the future of climate. You will have access to unparalleled career acceleration, with ownership and responsibility to lead the work you do from day one in a collaborative, diverse, non-hierarchical environment. You will have the opportunity to travel to client sites, locally and around the world. Lastly, you will be able to provide direct and measurable impact to some of the largest players from energy to agriculture around the globe.",1
